# CopyFiles -> python version

## This is a C command line tool designed to work on Windows and Linux as well. The purpose of this tool is to copy all the files matching a given pattern from a user given input to a user given destination directory.

In order to use this application:

I recommend a free open source Python IDE https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows in order to compile the code on Windows and Linux.

In order to compile it you have to write in the command line: main.py  \<input_path\>  \<output_path\> \<pattern\>
- this will automatically look for the pattern inside the input path folder structure and will copy all the files that match the pattern inside the output path
- a log file will be generated at the output path, containing the information about the files found.
